Implementing Machine learning word2vec algorithm in Python . I have used gensim library and matplotlib visualization library and used a crawler for crawling data from online newspaper. Here I have  worked semantic analysis and anomaly detection.

# requirements:
install gensim, pyqt, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, pandas codecs.

# Before use:
please extract the files and modify the train.py line number 29 change the directory to sentences = gensim.models.word2vec.PathLineSentences('(drive letter)\your folder \Workspace\\InputAll')
